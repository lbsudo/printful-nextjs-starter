## Setup

You'll first need to setup Stripe, Printful, and Clerk before you can run the storefront locally, or deploy.

Please also not that you will not be able to use the webhook functionality if you do not have your project deployed.


### 1. Setup Printful

<details>
  <summary>Login or create an account</summary>

You can [login](https://www.printful.com/auth/login), or [sign up](https://www.printful.com/auth/register) with Facebook, Google, Apple, and your email.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Create a new store</summary>
  
  You'll want to select **Manual order platform / API** from the available methods when [creating a new store](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/store).
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Add products to your inventory</summary>
  
  Let's add a product to your store.

1. Select from over 200 hundred products which you would like to sell.
2. Configure the product design by adding your logo, selecting available colors, and sizes.
3. Next, proceed to mockups to select the image that will be shown in the storefront. You can select from people wearing your product, to flat wrinkled mockups. **Make sure to select `PNG` as your "mockup format" when creating your product.**
4. Next, proceed to details where you can name your product. This name will be shown in the storefront.
5. Next, proceed to pricing, and set some prices. Here you'll see the price it costs you, and the retail prices you'll charge your customers. You can quickly increase/decrease the profit margin here too.
6. **Save product**

That's it! üéâ Repeat this step for all products you want to sell.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Don't forget, shipping and taxes are extra!

‚ÑπÔ∏è You can optionally create a [**Product Template**](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/product-templates) for items you may want to add to additional stores later.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure selling preferences</summary>
  
  Inside **Settings** > **Stores**, you'll want to configure your default selling preferences. You can specify your selling region. You can opt to sell worldwide, and choose products from a wide variety of products, or you can set a specific region, such as the UK.

Depending on where you sell, you'll be liable to pay (or collect + pay) VAT. If you are VAT registered, provide Printful your VAT ID so orders can reflect a zero VAT amount where applicable.

‚ÑπÔ∏è If you need to collect VAT from customers, make sure to enable the Tax API with Snipcart.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure shipping preferences</summary>
  
  Inside **Settings** > **Stores** > **Shipping**, you'll want to configure the USA & Europe settings.

The defaults should work for most, but you might want to make some adjustments for domestic and international shipping.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Create a Printful Private token</summary>
  
Inside **Settings** > **Stores** > **API**, click visit [Printful Developers](https://developers.printful.com/login).

From here you will want to create a new **Private token**, select the store you want to give this token access to, select the permissions (all), set an expiry and copy the value for use later as `PRINTFUL_API_KEY`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Add a billing method</summary>
  
You'll want to add a [billing method](https://www.printful.com/dashboard/billing/billing-methods) to Printful so you can fulfill orders.

When a customer makes an order, Printful will charge YOU to process the order. üì∫ [Learn more how Printful processes payments for order fulfillment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5lsHL8wji4&t=2s).

### 2. Setup Stripe

<details>

When your account is setup you will be able to see a button in the top navigation bar that will say 'Developers'. 

In this Developers dashboard you will be able to access the API keys for your Stripe account to be used in payment collection.
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure your website domain</summary>

It's important you configure your **Default Website Domain** so Stripe can successfully validate when checkouts are completed and 
initaite the webhook code that will create the printful order.

You may also want to add other domains, and subdomains if you're working locally with this but stripe also provides testing capability.

The domain you provide here will be your live URL, such as `staterecomm.com`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Configure webhooks</summary>

You'll want to configure the endpoint for webhooks. This webhook will be triggered at the post purchase stage.

This projects webhook is designed to listen for when **checkout.session.completed** but this can be customized to your desire.

Be sure to configure your webhook properly to access the automated order creation process.

For example, when a customer places a successful order, this webhook will be triggered, and it will call a function to add the order to Printful.

### 3. Setup Clerk

<details>
  <summary>Login or create an account</summary>

You need to [login](https://www.Clerk.com), or [sign up](https://www.Clerk.com) for [Clerk]().

</details>
